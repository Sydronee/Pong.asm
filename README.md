# Pong.asm

This is my attempt at recreating the classic Pong game using 8086 Assembly language.  
The project serves as a learning experience in low-level programming and understanding hardware interactions.

## Features

- **Assembly Implementation**: Core game logic written in 8086 Assembly.
- **Keyboard Input**: Handles user input for paddle movement.
- **Graphics Rendering**: Basic rendering of paddles and ball on the screen.
- **Collision Detection**: Simple collision mechanics between ball and paddles.

## Files

- `Pong.asm`: Main assembly source code for the game.
- `Keyboard.asm`: Handles keyboard input routines.
- `Pong1.c`: C version of the Pong game for comparison or alternative implementation.
- `build.bat`: Batch script to compile and build the project.
- `LICENSE`: Project license under GPL-3.0.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
